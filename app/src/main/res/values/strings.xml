Under Section 166A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), it addresses the offense committed by a public
servant, specifically a police officer, for failing to register an

    <string name="sarais_act">
Even any 5-star hotel can’t prohibit you from drinking potable
water and utilizing its washrooms.
        The Indian Sarais Act of 1887 is an old legislation that primarily deals with the regulation of public
accommodations, particularly sarais (inns or resting places) and
certain aspects related to them. However, this Act may not explicitly address the prohibition of
using washrooms or drinking potable water in 5-star hotels.
Modern 5-star hotels in India typically operate under different regulations and standards, often
complying with various hospitality and tourism laws, health and safety
standards, and local municipal regulations.

        if you encounter a situation where a 5-star hotel denies you access to basic facilities such as
washrooms or potable water, and you believe its unjustifiable,
here are steps you might consider:
1. Communicate with Hotel Staff: Initially, speak with the hotel staff or management politely and
inquire about the reason for the denial of access to the facilities.
Misunderstandings or policy clarifications could be resolved through communication.
2. Understand Hotel Policies: Ask for a copy of the hotel policies or rules. Often, hotels have
policies regarding the use of certain facilities, especially by non-guests,
which could clarify the situation.
3. Seek Assistance from Management: If the issue persists, escalate the matter to higher
management within the hotel. Explain the situation and try to resolve the matter
amicably.
4. Document the Incident: Keep records of your interactions, noting down details such as the time,
date, names of the staff you spoke with, and their responses. These
details might be useful if the situation escalates further.
5. Complain to Authorities: If the denial seems unjust or violates any laws, consider reporting the
incident to local authorities responsible for overseeing hospitality
services or consumer rights. They might provide guidance or intervene if necessary.
6. Legal Advice: Seek legal counsel if the denial of access seems unlawful or violates your rights. A
lawyer can guide you on the appropriate legal steps to take.
7. Review Regulations: Familiarize yourself with relevant local laws or regulations governing
hospitality services. This knowledge could support your case if the denial of
access breaches any regulations.
8. Review Public Review Platforms: Consider sharing your experience on public review platforms
or consumer rights forums. Sometimes, public exposure can prompt the
establishment to address the issue.

    Motor Vehicle Act, 1988:- As per Part 129 of the Indian Motor Automobile Act, sporting

    Act limits the utmost two riders on the bikes

    The Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 in India includes provisions related to road safety, traffic rules, and
    regulations for vehicles. Part 129 and Part 128 specifically address
    the safety measures for two-wheeler riders.
    Part 129 of the Motor Vehicles Act mandates the use of helmets for two-wheeler riders. It specifies
    that wearing a helmet is mandatory for individuals riding motorcycles,
    scooters, or any other two-wheeled vehicles. This regulation is aimed at reducing head injuries and
    enhancing the safety of riders in case of accidents.
    Part 128 of the Motor Vehicles Act limits the maximum number of riders allowed on motorcycles.
    According to this section, only a maximum of two persons are permitted on a
    two-wheeler at a time - this includes the rider and a pillion passenger. Carrying more than one

    two-wheelers. Wearing helmets is compulsory for the rider, and the law
    restricts the number of individuals riding a motorcycle at any given time to maintain safety
    standards on the roads. These regulations are put in place to reduce road
    accidents and minimize injuries, especially among two-wheeler riders

"Part 294 of the Indian Penal Code is a section that deals with obscene acts and songs in public places. It states that whoever, to the annoyance of others, does any obscene act or sings or recites any obscene content in a public place, can be punished with imprisonment up to three months, or a fine, or both. The section aims to prevent the disturbance of public decency and morality by such acts or songs. The term \obscene\ is not defined in the code, but it is generally interpreted as something that is offensive to modesty or decency. The section applies to all kinds of public places, such as streets, parks, theatres, etc., and to all kinds of obscene acts or songs, such as nudity, vulgar gestures, abusive language, etc. The section also covers the cases where the obscene act or song is done or sung in a private place, but is visible or audible to the public. The section is a cognizable and bailable offence, which means that the police can arrest the offender without a warrant and the offender can get bail from the court."
